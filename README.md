      We have created website as part of solution in initial phases. Using this website farmer can sell his product directly to retailers/companies by deals/MOU's. There will be option for search from customer side so that they can find appropriate farmer based on location and product they harvest. Farmer will have freedom of putting his own prices so that he get MSP(Minimum support price) very easily. Using this plateform farmer can grow his bussiness to any extent he wish.

## Installation & Usage 📦

Provide steps to install or use your project.

## Expected Outcomes 💯

We expected to have strong plateform between Farmers and customers (Consumers/ retailers/ companies) so that farmer can get his expected price. we could not create potential planning for cosumer to farmer enterprise directly howerver we are able to have good frameworks for deals/MOU with companies and retailer directly under our working model. 

## Future work 🤔

### - Making more user friendly and regional language friendly
we want to make this digital plateform easily usable and accessible for farmers by looking at thier digital literacy
### - involve shares of retailer in farming
most of the time farmers can not borrow more money to spend for production. but this issue can be resolved by involving potential retailers to invest in that crop as shares and later on return can be leveraged for both farmer and retailer
### - make group of farmers and have strong industry level supply
This is really important when farmers from same location selling same products. then they can have larger MOU with single company. 
### - avail government/ Cooperative benificiary on plateform
As a part of information gateway we can provide all updated details regarding government/ Cooperative benificiaries for farmers to their feed
### - Farming analysis for better product
We will do the alalysis of crops and production trends of past time for better solutions to farmers.
